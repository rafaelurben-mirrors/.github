# mirrors

Repository for keeping mirrors up to date.

This repository contains a github action that keeps external mirrors up to date by bare cloning the external repositories and pushing to a github repository using a PAT (personal access token).

Currently keeping up to date:

- [rafaelurben/pyatem-mirror](https://github.com/rafaelurben/pyatem-mirror) from <https://git.sr.ht/~martijnbraam/pyatem>
