# rafaelurben-mirrors

This organization keeps some mirrors up to date.

The [.github](https://github.com/rafaelurben-mirrors/.github) repository contains a github action that keeps external mirrors up to date by bare cloning the external repositories and pushing to a github repository using a PAT (personal access token).

Currently keeping up to date:

- [rafaelurben-mirrors/pyatem](https://github.com/rafaelurben-mirrors/pyatem) from <https://git.sr.ht/~martijnbraam/pyatem>
